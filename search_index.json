You cannot combine the resit with the midterm etc. 5.2 Useful to know The questions that we ask in the exam are based on the notebooks that we discuss in class. Hence make sure that you have these ready before the exam. You are allowed to use copy-paste out of these notebooks. During the semester, you can use google to find information on functions, error messages etc. However, during the exam you can only access a limited number of pages. In particular, during the exam you work in a special exam environment on TiU computers. We have asked IT to whitelist the following websites: the russet server (where you will do your exam) gitlab (where you will import your exam from) Blackboard (where we will give you the command to import the exam) stackoverflow python.org numpy scipy pandas datacamp cookbook tidyverse.org rpubs rstudio r4ds rdocumentation 5.3 Exam procedure we will post the exam both on gitlab. You will get instructions how to get the exam on the Russet server.r finishing your exam make sure that we can easily see which notebook is your exam that is, do not rename the exam notebook (so that we do not know which notebook it is) do not have 5 different versions of the exam notebook; we will then choose one at random and grade this one after you finish the exam, do not re-open the notebook again: we can see the last time the notebook was opened. If this is after you left the exam room, we can see this and will nullify your exam. "]
